# WHAT'S NEW IN VERSION 11

[Cotton Markdown Tables](https://m.pffy.dev/cotton) is constantly improving. Here are some of the recently added features:

  + Added a YouTube thumbnail generator

### HOW IT WORKS

In cell A1, enter the canonical YouTube watch URL, surrounded by double brackets:
```
<<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3jLJU7DT5E>>
```

Now, insert a new note to cell A1:

```
what is github?
```

This note annotates the YouTube video thumbnail. 

Next, run any Cotton Markdown tables conversion. The YouTube generator syntax converts to the following Markdown syntax:

```
[![what is github?](https://img.youtube.com/vi/w3jLJU7DT5E/mqdefault.jpg "what is github?")](https://www.youtube.com/watch?=w3jLJU7DT5E)
```

Here is what it looks like:

[![what is github?](https://img.youtube.com/vi/w3jLJU7DT5E/mqdefault.jpg "what is github?")](https://www.youtube.com/watch?=w3jLJU7DT5E)

Video information is also added to footnotes below the Markdown table.
