# Export Markdown tables from Google Sheets

The **Cotton Markdown Tables** add-on for Google Sheets is a new add-on that improves data sharing workflows.

### Export options

You have six methods of exporing data in Google Sheets to Markdown tables:

  1. **Export active range:** The most basic selection in a spreadsheet.
  2. **Export all active ranges:** This allows you to multi-select seperate ranges and export all the converted tables into a single Markdown table document.
  3. **Export entire sheet:** This method includes all the data within a sheet without user selection.
  4. **Export all sheets:** This method exports each sheet in the spreadsheet and places them into a single document.
  5. **Export selected named ranges:** Choose which predefined named ranges you want and save all the generated Markdown tables in a single Markdown document.
  6. **Export all named ranges:** Combine all the named ranges in a spreadsheet into a single Markdown document.

### Deliverables 

After you export Markdown tables with Cotton, you have three deliverables. 

You can:

  * Copy to clipboard
  * View the Markdown file in Google Drive
  * Download the Markdown file to your desktop
